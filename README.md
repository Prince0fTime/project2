# Project Ideas project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mjgardner/project2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mjgardner/project2)

This is a site for collecting project ideas, with features to comment and rate
them. Our target audience is ourselves or other students â€” we had trouble
coming up with a project idea, so we thought it would be nice to have a site
where anyone can submit ideas and comment on them.

Our goal is to make the site as self-explanatory as possible, with a home page
that displays all project ideas along with their average rating. We also
envision a search box, enabling the user to search project titles and
descriptions. Each project idea will have its own page, allowing the user to
edit the project title and description or add comments/ratings. The comments
can optionally be signed with an email address, which will be used to display
the commenter's [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) picture.

Stretch goals for the site include displaying an image for each project
idea (perhaps a screenshot or mockup) and a trending section that measures
project popularity by counting page views. Another stretch goal is adding
categories or tags for each project, along with separate category/tag pages.
